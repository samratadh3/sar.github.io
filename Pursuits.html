                    I am a passionate learner with a strong foundation in science, having completed high school at KEF Secondary School with a keen interest in the medical field. I have worked with startups like Nerf Nepal and Wind Network, gaining entrepreneurial experience. Beyond academics, I enjoy blogging, critiquing movies, and exploring creative fields like web design, animation, and graphic design. Additionally, I have completed a professional and executive development course from Harvard Division, strengthening my leadership and strategic skills. My journey is driven by continuous learning and innovation.
